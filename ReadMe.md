## Notes (Design Decisions/Cool Features!)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### New Design Decisions:

1. (Factory Pattern) In Monsters and Heroes/Legends of Valor, I used the Factory pattern to manage the creation of different character and monster types. By implementing a HeroFactory and MonsterFactory, each class is responsible for creating specific types of entities with appropriate stats and abilities. This choice simplifies adding new types of characters or monsters, as we only need to adjust the factory without changing other parts of the code. This approach reduces redundancy in the instantiation process and promotes scalability, allowing the game to introduce new characters or monster variations seamlessly. 
<br>
<br>
2. (Strategy Pattern) In Monsters and Heroes/Legends of Valor, I used the Strategy pattern to handle the different actions a heroes might perform, specifically Attack, Equip, Spell, and Potion actions. By defining each action as a separate strategy, I allowed characters to dynamically select and execute behaviors based on the current context, such as using a specific spell or equipping new armor. This pattern helps keep the code flexible and modular, as each action is encapsulated in its own strategy class, making it easy to add new actions or modify existing ones without impacting the core character logic. Overall, the Strategy pattern enhances reusability and adaptability, allowing for a more varied and dynamic gameplay experience.
   <br>
   <br>
3. (Singleton Pattern) In my Monsters and Heroes/Legends of Valor game, I implemented a singleton scanner pattern (SingletonScanner.java) to handle user input consistently throughout the game. By creating a single instance of the Scanner class and using it globally within the game, I ensured that input handling is streamlined and centralized. This pattern eliminates the need for multiple Scanner instances, preventing potential issues such as resource leaks or inconsistent input handling. Additionally, it enhances performance by reusing the same object, reducing overhead. The singleton scanner approach also makes the code more maintainable, as all user input logic is tied to a single point, making it easier to modify or extend in the future.
<br>
<br>
4. Our team decided to extend Legends of Valor from our Monsters and Hero class as an instance of a Legends of Valor game was pretty much a Monsters vs Heroes game, just with a different map and additional functionality (Ex. Recall, Teleportation). For that reason, it made sense to extend our Legends of Valor game from Heroes vs Monsters to inherit base functionality and reuse already written code.
   <br>
   <br>
5. Rather than create a class for each type of board type, we simply decided to make the board type (with the exception of a Market Board Piece) a field in the general board piece class. Since each of the other board piece types, like cave and bush, did not require any state, it made sense to make a field to differentiate different board types rather than create classes which would hold no state. By doing so, we made our code more simple.
   <br>
   <br>
5. In my project, I designed nearly 40 classes, each following the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) to ensure that every class has one clear responsibility. This approach not only made the codebase more organized and modular but also greatly enhanced its maintainability and scalability. For example, classes like GameController are dedicated solely to managing the flow of the game, while classes such as BoardPiece and Player focus on their specific aspects, like representing tiles and players respectively. By adhering to SRP, I ensured that each class could be easily understood, tested, and modified without affecting others. This separation of concerns allowed for better collaboration and quicker debugging, as changes in one part of the game wouldn't risk breaking unrelated functionality. Furthermore, this structure made it easier to extend the game in the future, whether adding new features or creating new game modes.

### Cool Features:

1. My Heroes and Monsters board size is scalable! You can have size of 5x5 or even 9x9!
   <br>
   <br>
2. The number of heroes a user chooses is also scalable! A user can choose to play with one hero or even 3!
   <br>
   <br>
3. During many states of the game, you will see color output. This has been used to make the sections of the game (Ex. Battle vs Market) more clear.
   <br>
   <br>
4. As I was (falsely) anticipating the idea of an extension project involving teams, I created a Team class that would be easily used for my Heroes and Monsters game later on. 

## How to compile and run
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Navigate to the directory "/MonstersAndHeroes/src" after unzipping the files
2. Run the following instructions:
   javac *.java
   java Main

3. Note: If this does not work, just run the main() in Main.java.

Welcome to Legends of Valor! The game board is an 8x8 grid, divided into three lanes with various types of spaces: Nexus, Inaccessible, Plain, Bush, Cave, and Koulou.
Each lane spans two columns, with impassable columns separating them. Heroes aim to reach the monsters' Nexus at the top, while monsters attempt to invade the heroes' Nexus at the bottom.

Spaces have different effects: Nexus spaces are spawning points and markets for heroes; Bush spaces boost hero dexterity; Cave spaces increase agility; and Koulou spaces enhance strength. 
Monsters receive no terrain bonuses.

Heroes control a team of three, with each hero occupying a lane. Heroes can perform actions such as moving, attacking, casting spells, using items, or teleporting to other lanes. 
They battle invading monsters, gathering gold and experience along the way.

Heroes and monsters act in rounds, with heroes going first. If a hero reaches the monster Nexus, they win. If a monster reaches the hero Nexus, the heroes lose.

The objective is to coordinate actions, use terrain to your advantage, and stop the monster invasion. Level up, strengthen your heroes, and protect the Nexus!


It is time to choose 3 heroes! Your i-th chosen hero will live in the i-th column of the game.

This is the remaining list of your possible heroes!
